**NOTE: All presentations are saved as PDF's with notes. This means you will not get the automation, animation, and there is image overlap. If you find a slide that you want formatted differently, please reach out to me and I will upload a modified PDF for you to read.**

**NOTE: All blogs are saved as PDF's from the website that they were originally posted on. I choose to do this to preserve the blogs in the format and medium they were presented in rather than the raw text that they were initially created from.**
